## Quicksilver iTerm2 plugin ##

This plugin provides functionality for having commands from the [Terminal
plugin](http://github.com/quicksilver/Terminal-qsplugin) work in
[iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/). It does so by registering iTerm2 as a
Command line interface.

When the iTerm2 plugin is installed, iTerm2 becomes available as a choice under
Command Line Interface in the Handlers section of the Quicksilver preferences.

### Actions ###

This plugin (as of now) does not have any actions of it's own, but the
following actions from the Terminal plugin are supported:

 * Run a Text Command in Terminal - Runs a text command entered in Quicksilver's text mode in the terminal.
 * Run in Terminal [...] - Runs the selected shell script in the terminal
 * Open Parent Directory in Terminal - Opens the selected directory's parent in the terminal
 * Open Directory in Terminal - Opens the selected directory in the terminal
